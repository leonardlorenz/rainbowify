# Rainbowify

Give it an image, a colour to replace inside the image and a fuzz factor to make sure very similar colours get replaced aswell.

## Here's a demonstration:

the input image on the left and the output files compiled together to a gif on the right:

![input](./metr1xx.png) ![output](./metr1xx.gif)

The resulting files which can be easily converted to a gif with ffmpeg. (you can find the command in imgtogif.sh)

![demo](./output.gif)
